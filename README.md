## üìñ Project overview

Pickering emulsions stabilized by nanocellulose are a rapidly growing field of research. However, understanding the complex relationships between nanocellulose properties, processing conditions, and emulsion outcomes requires analyzing a vast body of literature. This tool aims to simplify that process.

It provides an interactive interface to a database manually curated from over 80 peer-reviewed articles. Researchers, students, and industry professionals can use this platform to:
* Identify trends and correlations in the existing data.
* Discover knowledge gaps for future research.
* Accelerate the design and development of new emulsion-based applications.

## Key features

* **Interactive scatter plot:** Dynamically explore the relationship between any two numerical variables from the dataset. Data points can be colored by category (e.g., nanocellulose type) and filtered to isolate subsets of interest.
* **Droplet size distribution analysis:** Compare emulsion droplet sizes across different categorical groups using box plots.
* **Correlation matrix:** A heatmap that visualizes the Pearson correlation coefficients between all numerical parameters in the database.
* **Direct article linking:** Click on any data point in the scatter plot to open the original scientific article via its DOI.
* **CSV Data download:** The complete, curated dataset is available for download as a CSV file directly from the user interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS
* **Data Visualization:** Plotly.js
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript

## The Dataset

The dataset was manually curated from over 80 scientific articles and is embedded as a JSON object within the `index.html` file. It includes parameters such as:
* Nanocellulose type (CNC, CNF, etc.) and source (wood, cotton, bacterial, etc.)
* Chemical modifications and surface properties
* Particle dimensions and aspect ratio
* Emulsion type (o/w, w/o), oil type, and concentration
* Resulting droplet size and stability
